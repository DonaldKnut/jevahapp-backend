# Production Authentication & Email Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Login Error Message but Successful Login

**Problem**: Users get "invalid username and password" error but still get logged in.

**Root Cause**: This is likely a frontend issue where the error response is being displayed but the login actually succeeded.

**Solution**:

1. Check frontend error handling in login flow
2. Verify that the backend is returning consistent response formats
3. Ensure frontend properly handles both success and error states

### Issue 2: Registration Email Failure but User Created

**Problem**: Users get "unable to send email" but the user record is still created, causing "email already registered" on retry.

**Root Cause**: The registration flow was creating user records before sending verification emails.

**Solution**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Modified registration flow to send emails before creating user records.

### Issue 3: Zoho Email Configuration Issues

**Problem**: Email sending failures in production environment.

**Root Cause**: Potential Zoho SMTP configuration issues or environment variable problems.

## üîß Fixes Applied

### 1. Registration Flow Improvements

**Before (Problematic)**:

```typescript
// User record created first
const newUser = await User.create({...});

// Email sent after - if this fails, user record remains
await sendVerificationEmail(email, firstName, verificationCode);
```

**After (Fixed)**:

```typescript
// Email sent first
try {
  await sendVerificationEmail(email, firstName, verificationCode);
} catch (emailError) {
  throw new Error("Unable to send verification email. Please try again later.");
}

// User record created only after email success
const newUser = await User.create({...});
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

Added specific error handling for email-related failures:

```typescript
if (error.message.includes("Unable to send verification email")) {
  return response.status(500).json({
    success: false,
    message: error.message,
  });
}
```

### 3. Improved Email Configuration

Enhanced the email transporter with:

- Better timeout settings
- Connection verification before sending
- Detailed error logging
- Specific error messages for different failure types

## üß™ Testing Your Fixes

### 1. Test Email Configuration

Run the email test script to verify Zoho SMTP setup:

```bash
# Set your test email
export TEST_EMAIL=your-test-email@example.com

# Run the test
node scripts/test-email-config.js
```

### 2. Test Registration Flow

1. **Test successful registration**:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-app.onrender.com/api/auth/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "email": "test@example.com",
       "password": "password123",
       "firstName": "Test",
       "lastName": "User"
     }'
   ```

2. **Test email failure handling**:
   - Temporarily set wrong SMTP credentials
   - Attempt registration
   - Verify no user record is created
   - Verify proper error message is returned

### 3. Clean Up Orphaned Users

Run the cleanup script to identify and optionally remove orphaned user records:

```bash
node scripts/cleanup-orphaned-users.js
```

## üîç Zoho SMTP Troubleshooting

### Common Zoho Issues

1. **Authentication Failed (EAUTH)**:

   - ‚úÖ Use App Password, not regular password
   - ‚úÖ Enable SMTP access in Zoho settings
   - ‚úÖ Verify email address exists in Zoho account

2. **Connection Failed (ECONNECTION)**:

   - ‚úÖ Check SMTP_HOST: `smtp.zoho.com`
   - ‚úÖ Check SMTP_PORT: `587` for TLS, `465` for SSL
   - ‚úÖ Verify firewall allows outbound SMTP connections

3. **Connection Timeout (ETIMEDOUT)**:
   - ‚úÖ Check internet connectivity
   - ‚úÖ Verify Zoho services are not down
   - ‚úÖ Try different port (587 vs 465)

### Environment Variables Checklist

Ensure these are set in your Render environment:

```bash
# Required
SMTP_HOST=smtp.zoho.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=support@jevahapp.com
SMTP_PASS=your-zoho-app-password

# Optional (for testing)
TEST_EMAIL=your-test-email@example.com
```

### Zoho Setup Verification

1. **Log into Zoho Mail**
2. **Go to Settings ‚Üí Mail Accounts**
3. **Select support@jevahapp.com**
4. **Go to Security tab**
5. **Enable SMTP Access**
6. **Generate App Password**
7. **Use App Password in SMTP_PASS**

## üìä Monitoring & Alerts

### 1. Email Delivery Monitoring

Monitor these metrics in production:

- Email sending success rate
- Email delivery rate
- Bounce rate
- Spam complaints

### 2. Application Logs

Look for these log patterns:

```
‚úÖ Email sent successfully: { messageId, to, subject }
‚ùå Email send failed: { error, to, subject, templateName }
```

### 3. Database Monitoring

Check for:

- Users with `isEmailVerified: false` but no verification code
- Users created but never verified
- Failed login attempts

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Test email configuration locally
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set in Render
- [ ] Test registration flow with email sending
- [ ] Test login flow with proper error handling
- [ ] Run cleanup script to identify orphaned users
- [ ] Monitor logs after deployment

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If issues persist:

1. **Revert to previous email configuration**:

   ```typescript
   // Revert to simple transporter
   const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
     host: process.env.SMTP_HOST || "smtp.zoho.com",
     port: parseInt(process.env.SMTP_PORT || "587"),
     secure: process.env.SMTP_SECURE === "true",
     auth: {
       user: process.env.SMTP_USER || "support@jevahapp.com",
       pass: process.env.SMTP_PASS || "",
     },
   });
   ```

2. **Consider alternative email services**:
   - SendGrid
   - Mailgun
   - Amazon SES
   - Resend (already configured in the app)

- **Render Environment Variables**: https://render.com/docs/environment-variables

## üéØ Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Registration Flow

1. User submits registration form
2. System validates input
3. System attempts to send verification email
4. **If email fails**: Return error, no user record created
5. **If email succeeds**: Create user record, return success

### Login Flow

1. User submits login credentials
2. System validates credentials
3. **If invalid**: Return "Invalid email or password" error
4. **If valid but unverified**: Return "Please verify your email" error
5. **If valid and verified**: Return success with JWT token

### Email Flow

1. System generates verification code
2. System sends email with code
3. **If email fails**: Throw specific error with details
4. **If email succeeds**: Continue with user creation

This should resolve the issues you're experiencing in production.
