---

## 📋 Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Nested Replies in Get Comments Response

**What Changed:**
- `getContentComments()` now returns comments with nested `replies` array
- Each top-level comment includes its direct replies (up to 50 replies per comment)
- Replies are formatted with the same structure as parent comments

**Implementation:**
- Added `formatCommentWithReplies()` helper method
- Added `fetchCommentReplies()` helper method
- Updated both `sortBy: "top"` and default sorting paths to include nested replies

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "comments": [
      {
        "_id": "commentId",
        "id": "commentId",
        "content": "Comment text",
        "authorId": "userId",
        "userId": "userId",
        "author": { "firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe", "avatar": "..." },
        "user": { "firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe", "avatar": "..." },
        "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
        "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
        "reactionsCount": 5,
        "likes": 5,
        "replies": [
          {
            "_id": "replyId",
            "content": "Reply text",
            "author": { ... },
            "reactionsCount": 2
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "totalComments": 45,
    "hasMore": true,
    "pagination": { ... }
  }
}
```

---

### 2. ✅ Comment Like/Reaction Endpoint

**What Changed:**
- Updated existing `/api/interactions/comments/:commentId/reaction` endpoint
- Controller now uses `contentInteractionService.toggleCommentReaction()`
- Response format matches frontend expectations

**Endpoint:**
```
POST /api/interactions/comments/:commentId/reaction
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "reactionType": "like"  // Optional, defaults to "like"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "liked": true,
    "totalLikes": 6
  }
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Added `toggleCommentReaction()` service method
- Handles Mongoose Map conversion correctly
- Supports toggle (like/unlike) functionality
- Returns `liked` boolean and `totalLikes` count

---

### 3. ✅ Response Format Updates

**What Changed:**

1. **Field Name Aliasing:**
   - Comments now return both `user` AND `author` fields
   - Added `userId` and `authorId` aliases
   - Added `id` alias for `_id`
   - Added `timestamp` alias for `createdAt`
   - Added `likes` alias for `reactionsCount`

2. **hasMore Flag:**
   - Added `hasMore` boolean to pagination response
   - Calculated as `(page * limit) < total`
   - Frontend can use this to determine if more comments are available

3. **totalComments Field:**
   - Added `totalComments` field alongside `pagination.total`
   - Matches frontend expectations

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "comments": [...],
    "totalComments": 45,
    "hasMore": true,
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "limit": 20,
      "total": 45,
      "pages": 3
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 4. ✅ Reactions Count Field

**What Changed:**
- All comments now include `reactionsCount` field
- Calculated from `reactions` Map/object
- Also includes `likes` alias for frontend compatibility

**Implementation:**
- `formatCommentWithReplies()` calculates reaction count
- Handles both Map and plain object formats
- Sums all reaction types or just "like" depending on context

---
