We've been called to step boldly in the authority weâ€™ve been given and crush everything that stands against the light of God's word. Jugular is the sound of victory, the sound of spiritual warfare, and the sound of a generation that refuses to bow. If youâ€™ve ever felt surrounded, this is your reminder. Youâ€™re not fighting from defeat but from victory. Heaven backs you, fire surrounds you, and you have the power to overcome. Raise your voice. Take your stand. Break the jugular!!!",

      "YOU WILL TAKE FASTING & PRAYER SERIOUSLY AFTER HEARING THIS - POWER OF FASTING - APOSTLE AROME OSAYI",
    description:
      "The power of fasting and prayer that you need to know and listen to now. What does fasting and prayer do to you? These are what will happen as you engage in it. What an instructive message that shows the necessity of prayer and fasting. The way of the kingdom has been set for our advantage and one of the ways to take advantage of what belongs to us in the kingdom as a result of what Christ did is by continual fasting and prayer. Prayer and fasting help one to get bold in the things of God especially in the face of opposition. It weakens the power of the flesh which always lust against the spirit. The consciousness level of a Believer who gives himself to fasting and prayer is always at a heightened level - the more we engage in these spiritual activities, the more we are transformed and the more we have confidence and trust to do the will of God. It's as important as anything, a Believer must fast, pray, study the word, and fellowship with the brethren - these are the activities of God's kingdom - it's says this is the era of spiritual men. Men who will do the will of God, men who will put to nothing the power of darkness, and men who will stand for Jesus everywhere.",
